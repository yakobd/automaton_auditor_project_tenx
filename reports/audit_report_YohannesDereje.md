## Criteria

### Git Forensic Analysis (git_forensic_analysis)
- **Final Score:** 3/5
- **Dissent Summary:** No significant dissent detected.
- **Remediation:** Address confirmed security vulnerability immediately and rerun full audit before release.
- **Judge Opinions:**
  - Prosecutor: score=1, argument=The repository under audit fails to demonstrate sufficient atomic commit progress, with only 1 commit detected, indicating a lack of incremental development and potential for hidden bugs. Furthermore, the absence of documentation coverage and the failure to provide meaningful commit history raise significant concerns about reliability, security, and process risk. The presence of a single commit with a vague message does not inspire confidence in the development process. While the repository may have some positive aspects, such as the presence of LangGraph StateGraph implementation and no leaked secret files, these are outweighed by the significant shortcomings in development process and documentation.
