Dissent Summary: **Dissenting Opinion:**

I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision, citing significant concerns regarding score conflicts and evidence certainty gaps. The structured output enforcement criterion reveals a variance of 4.00, indicating a substantial discrepancy in the application of the law. This variance is particularly troubling given the prosecutor's score of 1, suggesting a lack of confidence in the prosecution's case, and the defense's score of 5, indicating a strong confidence in their defense.

Furthermore, the report accuracy criterion also shows a variance of 4.00, raising questions about the reliability of the evidence presented. The absence of a tech lead and repository confidence scores further exacerbates these concerns, as it suggests a lack of oversight and quality control in the collection and analysis of evidence.

In light of these score conflicts and evidence certainty gaps, I believe it is imperative that we re-examine the evidence and reconsider the application of the law in this case. The majority's decision may be premature and potentially flawed, and I urge my colleagues to join me in seeking a more thorough and rigorous review of the evidence.
