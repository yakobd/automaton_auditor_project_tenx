## Criterion Breakdown

### Git Forensic Analysis (git_forensic_analysis)
#### Final Score
3/5
#### Dissent Summary
No significant dissent detected.
#### Remediation
Address confirmed security vulnerability immediately and rerun full audit before release.
#### Judge Opinions
  - Prosecutor: score=1, argument=The repository under audit fails to demonstrate a reliable and secure development process. With only one commit detected, the project's history appears sparse and lacks incremental progress, indicating a high-risk 'big bang' commit pattern. Furthermore, the absence of meaningful commit messages and the lack of documentation coverage raise serious concerns about the project's maintainability and adherence to best practices. The presence of a LangGraph StateGraph implementation is overshadowed by the overall lack of transparency and accountability in the development process. The prosecution argues that these findings pose significant risks to the reliability, security, and overall quality of the project.
